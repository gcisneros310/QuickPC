# Quick PC

Quick PC is a dedicated mobile application/webapp for finding PC Components and making price lists written in Dart using Flutter.

## Introduction

The application is designed to help users compare prices and compatibility of PC components. Our app can recommend parts based on the userâ€™s budget and consider what they want to use the PC for. The app can also compare prices from different retailers to find the best deal for users looking for parts. 

Due to the covid pandemic, many people have gained interests in building a computer from scratch. Our mobile application intends to assist people in learning the different types of PC components and their respective prices through the use of our mobile application. No such applications are widely available for mobile devices at the moment and the best version of this type of software is typically in the form of a mobile website which is unintuitive to use.

Quick PC will start up asking the user to login to their already registered account or register for a newly made account. Once a user has signed into their account they will arrive at the home screen which is the launch screen. This main page acts as the entry point into our application. 
This screen features a guide on how to assemble a PC, a page on what each part of a PC does, performance comparison on certain parts, a search bar for looking up parts, a system builder, and the ability to browse by parts. 

The end goal of Quick PC is to give users an accessible and informative way to build and assemble a computer that fits their needs. The app can act as a gateway to learning about PC components and understanding the functions of each part.
